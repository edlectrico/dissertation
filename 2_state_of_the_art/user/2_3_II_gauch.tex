Towards the goal of personalized navigation of online information~\citet{gauch_ontology_based_2003}
provide a user ontology for dynamically modelling the user browsing. The ontology
is formed by several concepts which are weighted indicating the user's perceived
interest in the corresponding concept. These concepts are related with surfing
experience (i.e., the content, length and time spent) on each Web page and
classified into the reference ontology. Hence, the user profile is created 
automatically. This means that the user profile information is collected 
implicitly without user feedback, as the ontology's concepts are automatically 
weighted considering the amount of related information from the user browsing.
