Several studies, as the research presented by~\citet{evers_achieving_2012},
recognize that it is complex to perform interfaces adaptations without bothering
the user. On the one hand, adapting an interface without the participation of the
user might lead to an unsatisfactory result. On the other hand, asking too much
for participation might bother the user. 
% From this work we assume that if the user
% has high stress levels the corresponding application should not ask for interaction.
% This way, the application should operate as ``automatic'' and 
% ``self-sufficient'' as possible. 
Following this stress perspective~\citet{liao_decision_2005} present an unified 
probabilistic decision model based on Influence Diagrams for modelling user stress 
levels. These levels were inferred by probabilistic inferences of several sources 
data (e.g., heart rate, mouth openness, head movements, or pupils monitoring).
