Within an application personalization within mobile 
environments~\citet{skillen2012ontological} present a User Profile Ontology 
which is able of modelling dynamic components. The ontology considers both 
static and dynamic aspects of the user mainly focused on his/her behaviour 
changes. In this work, user capabilities are also taken into account for the 
user profile. Capabilities are defined as the extent to which the user has an 
ability (i.e., physical, emotional or cognitive) to carry out some activities. 
User's interests and several context parameters are also considered in the 
ontology to cover context-aware environments. Figure~\ref{fig:skillen_ontology}
overviews the User Profile Ontology classes, object properties and data properties
presented by~\citeauthor{skillen2012ontological}.
