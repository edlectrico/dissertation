Within a video adaptation and quality of experience evaluation scenario,
~\citet{pereira_triple_2005} studies a user characterization through three
different dimensions: sensory, perceptual and emotional. First of all,
\citeauthor{pereira_triple_2005} establishes the difference between sensations 
and perceptions as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Sensations} are monomodal, more low-level, physical and less 
  related to the real world composition than perceptions. They regard the simple 
  conscious experience for the corresponding physical stimulus (e.g., light 
  variation and eyes reaction to this change). They are related to the first 
  contact between a human and the surrounding environment.
  
  \item \textit{Perceptions} are multimodal, and they are part of the cognition 
  process (knowing and learning) and regard the conscious experience and 
  identification of objects.
\end{itemize}

On the other hand, emotions are considered as central in a communication and 
entertainment process. Therefore, \citeauthor{pereira_triple_2005} proposes a 
triple layered \ac{spe} user model for the evaluation of the quality of 
experience in the consumption of multimedia content.
