\citet{golemati_creating_2007} present an ontology which, considering past 
literature solutions, aims to reduce the intrinsic problems of user modelling: 
ad-hoc modelling processes, the required amount of work to model users and the 
possibility of errors by omitting several user's characteristics. To this end,
authors present an extensible, comprehensive and general ontology whose design
is addressed through a top-down approach by firstly collecting static information
about the user. Next, the ontology designers analyse the semantics of the profile
models and suggest concepts that would adequately model them. It is remarkable
that this work is focused on static user characteristics, although they consider 
the possibility of incorporating dynamic and temporal characteristics.
