\citeauthor{mcavoy_ontology_based_2012} propose an ontology-based system for the 
managing of context within smart environments. One of the most significant 
contributions deals with the high-level information managed through the metadata 
and meaning which are collected by the sensor network~\citep{mcavoy_ontology_based_2012}. 
The sensing devices within the smart environment have to be modelled in order 
to be semantically enriched. Data is formally represented as an ontology by 
using entities and the relationships which link them together. After the data 
is collected from the sensors it is passed to an enrichment module where it is 
made semantically rich. This new enriched data is stored in a semantic 
repository in the form of triples. The meaning of this information and the 
metadata are added to the data within this enrichment component.
