\subsubsection{2008: Wood et al. and the AlarmNet system}

\label{sec:wood}

AlarmNet is an \ac{aal} \ac{wsn} for pervasive adaptive healthcare in assisted 
living residences for patients with special needs. \citet{wood_context_aware_2008} 
contribute with several novelties:

\begin{itemize}
  \item An extensible heterogeneous network middleware.
  \item Novel context-aware protocols.
  \item SenQ, a query protocol for efficiently streaming sensor data.
\end{itemize}

The context-aware protocol uses a two-way network information flow. On the one 
hand, environmental, system and residents data flow. On the other hand, \ac{car} 
analysis goes back into the system to enable smart power management and dynamic 
alerts.

Several sensors are used for sensing environmental quality: light, temperature,
dust, resident activities (motion sensors) and so on. The devices' queries to the 
system are negotiated by a Query Manager.
