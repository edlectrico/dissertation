\citet{jameson_modelling_2001} analyses in 2001 how context-aware computing 
represents a challenging frontier for researchers in the field of \acp{aui}. 
In this work information about the environment, the user's current 
state, longer term user properties and the user behaviour are compared in order 
to take the correct adaptation decision. The idea is to compare several 
scenarios. In the first one, only information about the environment is 
considered. In the following scenarios the user's current state, behaviour and 
long-term properties are taken into account. Thus, the results conclude 
that considering a wider range of user information can help context-aware 
systems designers.
