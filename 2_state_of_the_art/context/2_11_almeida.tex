\subsubsection{2013: Almeida and López-de-Ipiña: The AMBI2ONT Ontology}
\label{sec:almeida}

\citet{almeida_assessing_2012} consider two common problems dealing with 
ambiguity in the area of context modelling: the uncertainty and the vagueness. 
Uncertainty models the likeness of a certain fact, while the vagueness 
represents the degree of membership to a fuzzy set. The uncertainty is 
represented by a certainty factor.

Due to the nature of the process of collecting data from the environment, the
proposed ontology has been designed to support two types of uncertainty:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Uncertain data: This kind of uncertainty is generated from the capture
  of data from sensors due to the imperfect nature of the devices.
  \item Uncertain rules: It occurs in the execution of the rules. 
\end{itemize}

To reason over the ambiguous information the JFuzzy Logic Open Source fuzzy
reasoner has been adapted to support uncertainty information.
