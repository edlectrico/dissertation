Assuming that context-aware systems adapt to the specific user situation,
\citet{baltrunas_incarmusic_2011} present a music recommendation system which
takes into account the user's mood and the traffic conditions. To this end, the 
authors design a methodology through which users can be requested to judge several
contextual factors (e.g., if current traffic conditions are relevant for a decision
making task) and to rate an item when a certain contextual condition is met. 

In order to take into account the user's music preference and the influence that
context might have into them, context is modelled as several independent factors.
