\section{The Application Layer}
\label{sec:application_layer}

The last layer of the AdaptUI architecture is the Application Layer. This layer
aims to ease the use of the AdaptUI platform to developers. To do this, several
tools have been provided. These tools have been designed not only to integrate
AdaptUI within developers' applications (to adapt their user interfaces) but also
to leave in their hands the decision of how to manage the knowledge of the AdaptUI
platform. Thus, through the AdaptUI provided \ac{api}, developers are allowed to:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
 \item Initialize a Pellet reasoner and connect the application to it, loading
 the AdaptUIOnt ontology and its rules.
 
 \item Launch queries about the knowledge stored in the ontology in order to
 adapt the corresponding user interface elements.
 
 \item Generate, change and adapt the knowledge contained in AdaptUI. Classes,
 properties and relationships described in the AdaptUIOnt ontology are fully
 customizable by developers to cover the domain of their adaptation problem.
 
 \item Customize the provided set of rules. The AdaptUI \ac{api} provides a set of
 methods to edit different rules.
\end{enumerate}

The AdaptUI's \ac{api} can be internally divided into two separated \acp{api}. 
The first one, aiming to solve developer's adaptation issues. 
Listing~\ref{lst:api_adaptation} shows an example of an Android activity 
developed using AdaptUI. The second one, with the purpose of adapting the 
knowledge of the domain (see an example in Listing~\ref{lst:api_knowledge}).
