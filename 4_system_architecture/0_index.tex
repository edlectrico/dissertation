During this dissertation several problems of adaptive systems have been remarked.
Special attention has been paid to their lack of dynamism, the problems of 
modelling (\textit{what} and \textit{how} to model, the \textit{depth} of the 
model and the \textit{required knowledge} in the domain) and the external 
services and platforms dependency to perform computational complex operations. 
Addressing these issues, this dissertation aims a fully operational mobile 
platform which also acts as a demonstrator of the models described in Chapter~\ref{cha:ontology_model}. 
This chapter describes the three-layered architecture designed for AdaptUI, the
adaptation platform. The architecture layers and their modules are depicted in 
Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}.

Each layer of the AdaptUI adaptation platform is composed of several modules;
each module aiming to solve a concrete requisite. First, there is the Modelling
Layer which collects information of the user's (non physiological) capabilities
and context and device characteristics to finally build a semantic representation
of this knowledge. Two main modules form the Modelling Layer: the Capabilities
Collector and the Semantic Modeller. On the one hand, the Capabilities Collector's
main goal is to obtain information about each entity. On the other hand, the Semantic
Modeller leads the semantic representation and storage of the information
collected by the Capabilities Collector.

Next, there is the Adaptation Layer, which manages the adaptation process of the
user interface components through the Adaptation Engine. Together with the
Adaptation Engine there is the Adaptation Polisher module. This module aims to
refine the adapted user interface by analysing several usability metrics of the
user interaction.

Finally, the Application Layer provides several tools for developers to be able
to use AdaptUI. Through the provided \ac{api} developers are allowed not only to
make their applications adaptive, but also to add, edit and delete knowledge and
rules.

In the next sections of this chapter each layer and module is more concretely
explained. In Section~\ref{sec:modelling_layer} the Modelling Layer and
its two modules are introduced. The Capabilities Collector is described in
Section~\ref{sec:capabilities_collector}, while the Semantic Modeller is 
detailed in Section~\ref{sec:semantic_modeller}. The Adaptation Layer is 
presented in Section~\ref{sec:adaptation_layer}. This section also details the 
Adaptation Polisher (see Section~\ref{sec:adaptation_polisher}). Next,
Section~\ref{sec:application_layer} presents the characteristics of the 
Application Layer.

In addition, in Section~\ref{sec:architecture_flow}, the relationships among 
the mentioned layers and modules and the flow of the information and knowledge 
within the AdaptUI platform is depicted. Finally, a detailed example is
described in Section~\ref{sec:complete_example} following the information flow
mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:architecture_flow}, highlighting the concrete
tasks performed by each layer and module.
