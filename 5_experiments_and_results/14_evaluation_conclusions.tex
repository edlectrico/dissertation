\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:evaluation_conclusions}

During this dissertation we have introduced AdaptUI as a platform for dynamic
user interface adaptation. As new technical contributions have been developed 
and detailed (e.g., a mobile reasoning engine), several experiments regarding 
this area have been presented. Comparing the presented system with others gives
us the perspective to criticise AdaptUI and extract several conclusions. In this
section these conclusions are depicted.

On the one hand, the performed technical experiments revealed that mobile 
reasoning engines are useful, practical and affordable regarding performance. It
is true that, in this case \textit{Pellet4Android} suffers depending on the 
hardware of the device. Besides, the more axioms we add to the corresponding 
ontology (specially to the \ac{swrl} axioms set), the more delay in the performance 
of the system is added. However, we believe that the AdaptUIOnt ontology is 
light enough to be easily managed by any Android based device. Furthermore, the 
smartphones market is increasing the possibilities of these devices by 
improving their hardware capabilities. This means that in the near future 
complex processing will be totally affordable by these devices. 

The comparison with Imhotep exposes several benefits of AdaptUI. The first one, 
is the lack of dependency on external services or servers. This fact does not 
only have an affect on the performance, it avoids possible network failure 
problems. Another fundamental aspect that should be emphasized due to this 
comparison is the way users are modelled. While in Imhotep specific user 
disabilities are needed, AdaptUI just requires a simple interaction with the 
Capabilities Collector module. The interaction of the user is translated to the 
AdaptUIOnt ontology, and the rest of the adaptation process is delegated to the 
AdaptUI platform. Besides, AdaptUI relies on the Adaptation Polisher to perform
slight modifications on the fly of the adapted user interface, in case the 
interaction with the user is not satisfactory. Regarding the time 
performances, although using cached applications in Imhotep shown a faster 
response, the truth is that regarding new and real scenarios revealed a much 
bigger accuracy in AdaptUI. This has been shown through the scenarios presented 
in Section~\ref{sec:scenarios}.

On the other hand XX users have tested the platform and have been asked about 
its usability. Users seem to react satisfactorily to AdaptUI. The obtained 
results through the questionnaire show how depending on the users ageing and 
technical knowledge they feel more or less comfortable with it. These results
also exposes how most developers would use it as a tool for their applications, 
but not as users. On the contrary, users who declare to suffer sometimes from
context disabilities are willing to use it integrated with their Android device.
