\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}

Although all the accomplishments covered by AdaptUI, there are still several 
areas and features in which more efforts are required to improve the presented 
results. Consequently, in this section we present several ideas about future 
research actions and, in some cases, an explanation of the the steps that have 
been already taken are given.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
  \item Dynamic self-generation adaptive rules. Although AdaptUI provides three 
  different sets of rules, these rules are static, and they always depend on 
  the corresponding developer to be designed. This means that rules have to 
  be added in a previous stage, when users are still not present. In the near 
  future we aim to provide to AdaptUI an extra module capable of generate and 
  adapt in running time different rules considering several context change 
  triggers. Thus, from a default set of rules, these rules would be personalized 
  through the user experience.
  
  \item A further \textit{Pellet4Android} evaluation and tests are needed. The
  provided Pellet based mobile reasoning engine seeks functionality. Therefore,
  although it provides promising results running in Android devices, deeper 
  stress and  more complex processing experiments are planned. A deeper
  comparison of both versions of Pellet should produce more concluding results.
  
  \item AdaptUI basically covers disabilities related to visual and hearing
  sensory limitations. A further study and analysis of these and more 
  disabilities, based on the \ac{icf}, would include more users and better 
  adaptations of the user interfaces.
  
  \item Translate the models to JSON-LD\footnote{http://json-ld.org/}, which is
  a JSON based Linked Data format.
