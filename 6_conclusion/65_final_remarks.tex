\section{Final Remarks}
\label{sec:final_remarks}

This dissertation is the result of years of research including several areas
within the \acl{aui} field. With it, I have tried to contribute with significant 
improvements considering the current state of the art. Besides, I deem that these 
contributions will further help a more widespread adoption of adaptive user 
interfaces design for users with disabilities. I also hope that this thesis will 
inspire and contribute to the scientific community, as others have undoubtedly 
inspired me.
