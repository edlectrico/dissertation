The existing literature approaches for user, context and device modelling
analysed in Chapter~\ref{cha:state_of_the_art} revealed several problems in
systems which aim the adaptation of user interfaces, applications or services.
To face these issues regarding a user interface adaptation the AdaptUI system
described in this dissertation proposes a platform supported by two main bases:
AdaptUIOnt, an ontology which describes the most significant concepts within a
user interface adaptation domain, and a set of rules, which main purpose is
to trigger different actions regarding the available knowledge of the current
domain represented through the ontology.

The following sections detail the concepts illustrated through Figure~\ref{fig:flow_diagram}.
This figure presents, on the one hand, several crucial concepts represented
through the AdaptUIOnt ontology. The ontology and all its characteristic are
detailed in Section~\ref{sec:adaptui_model}. On the other hand, the set of rules
which concern these concepts are also depicted. These rules are described in
Section~\ref{sec:adaptui_rules}. This first diagram is unfolded during this
chapter and finally reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:adaptui_conclusions} through
Figure~\ref{fig:flow_diagram_2} in order to update the illustration with all the
described model and the learned concepts.
