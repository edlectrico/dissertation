The existing literature approaches for user, context and device modelling
analysed in Chapter~\ref{cha:state_of_the_art} revealed several problems in
systems which aim the adaptation of user interfaces, applications or services.
To face these issues (regarding a user interface adaptation) a platform supported 
by two main bases is proposed: AdaptUIOnt, an ontology which describes the most 
significant concepts within a user interface adaptation domain is proposed. Secondly,
a set of rules, which main purpose is to trigger different actions regarding the 
available knowledge of the current domain represented through the ontology.

The following sections detail the concepts illustrated through Figure~\ref{fig:flow_diagram}.
This figure presents, on the one hand, several crucial concepts represented
through the AdaptUIOnt ontology. The ontology and all its characteristic are
detailed in Section~\ref{sec:adaptui_model}. On the other hand, the set of rules
which concern these concepts are also depicted. These rules are described in
Section~\ref{sec:adaptui_rules}. This first diagram is unfolded during this
chapter and finally reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:adaptui_conclusions} (specially 
through Figure~\ref{fig:flow_diagram_2}) in order to update the illustration with 
all the described model and the learned concepts.
